# Skeleton UI

A lightweight CSS toolkit built on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/). It aims to provide simple to use responsive components that are not bloated with unnecessary features. This project replaces Skeleton Extras.

Currently there is no guarantee the toolkit will work on any browsers other than Firefox 37 and Chromium 42.
